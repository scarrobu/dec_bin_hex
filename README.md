# dec_bin_hex

**TASK:**

Write a simple program for conversion:
1. from dec to bin / hex system
2. from bin to dec system
3. creation of 256 local binary number and its SHA256 version (just for curriosity).

**SOLUTION:**

The program in a simple menu allows the user to choose what he wants to do. a valid selection continues in the program, an invalid one terminates it.

**NOTE:**

Choice 3 is just for curriosity. BTC address can be created on paper by tossing a coin, I imitated such an action and just for fun added the change of this address to SHA265, but it has no practical use.
